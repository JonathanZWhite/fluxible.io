The doc site for [Fluxible](https://github.com/yahoo/fluxible).


## Setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

There is also a /secrets.example.js file that you need to copy to /secrets.js with your GitHub API to allow the app to access the page content it needs from github.


## Run the app

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

This will use `nodemon` and `webpack` to watch for changes and restart and
rebuild as needed.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)



### Production

To run in production, use `NODE_ENV=production npm run dev`. This will use the production
assets that `webpack` generates. NOTE, this may break your application if the asset hashes
are not on CDN.



## Testing

Unit tests can be run via `npm test`.

To run functional tests, ensure you have `webdriver` updated:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/webdriver-manager update --standalone
```

Then run `npm run func` to run protractor to execute the functional tests.
